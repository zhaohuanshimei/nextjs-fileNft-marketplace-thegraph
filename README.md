## Inspiration

The patrick's lesson inspired me.

## What it does

It allows people to share anything in a decentralized way.

## How we built it

By repeat patrick's nft-marketplace project to start, and make adjustments when the something was different, finally add some new features for the marketplace, for the nft contract and for front end.

## Challenges we ran into

There were many challenges during reading English, learning patrick's lesson, coding with him, all the preparation were kind of hard for a beginner. but to develop a whole project with all basic functions were the hardest work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I am very happy to share the project to you as my first dAPP, and I believe that the ideas are always motivating the Web3 world.

## What we learned

The NFT standard, the NFT metadata , the ERC721 and ERC1155 details, the listener of solidity events, the GRAPH QL, and so many front end knowledge.
